Back Off! I just backed up bench_mpi.log to ./#bench_mpi.log.1#

NOTE: Error occurred during GPU detection:
      CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version
      Can not use GPU acceleration, will fall back to CPU kernels.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.24


Will use 24 particle-particle and 8 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 32 MPI processes
Using 7 OpenMP threads per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity

Back Off! I just backed up traj.trr to ./#traj.trr.1#

Back Off! I just backed up ener.edr to ./#ener.edr.1#

step 75 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 10.9 %.


step 500 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 5000 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 2.2 %.


step 5500 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 7500 Will no longer try dynamic load balancing, as it degraded performance.


Writing final coordinates.
