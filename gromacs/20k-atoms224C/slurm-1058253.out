NOTE: Error occurred during GPU detection:
      CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version
      Can not use GPU acceleration, will fall back to CPU kernels.

Writing final coordinates.

 Average load imbalance: 16.6 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 6.8 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.258
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 12.1 %

NOTE: 6.8 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)

NOTE: 12.1 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.
