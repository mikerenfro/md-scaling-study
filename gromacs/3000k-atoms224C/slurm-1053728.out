      CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version
      Can not use GPU acceleration, will fall back to CPU kernels.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.223


Will use 24 particle-particle and 8 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 32 MPI processes
Using 7 OpenMP threads per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'Her1-Her1'
10000 steps,     20.0 ps.

step 75 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 4.4 %.


Writing final coordinates.

 Average load imbalance: 5.7 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 3.7 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.765
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 5.1 %

NOTE: 5.1 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
