Command line:
  gmx mdrun -nt 28 -s benchmark.tpr -g bench.log


NOTE: Error occurred during GPU detection:
      CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version
      Can not use GPU acceleration, will fall back to CPU kernels.


Running on 1 node with total 28 cores, 28 logical cores, 0 compatible GPUs
Hardware detected:
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v4 @ 2.40GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX2_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX2_256

  Hardware topology: Basic

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.24


Will use 20 particle-particle and 8 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 28 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Great Red Owns Many ACres of Sand'
50000 steps,    100.0 ps.

step 75 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 8.2 %.


Writing final coordinates.

 Average load imbalance: 2.2 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.8 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.507
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 12.7 %

NOTE: 12.7 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
